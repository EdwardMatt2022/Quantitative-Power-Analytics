The purpose of this project is to model energy demand (GWh) in ERCOT with indepedent variables such as temperature, EV stock prices, commodity prices, and macroeconomic indicators.
We want to forecast demand and ERCOT was chosen to represent the American Power Market. Machine Learning algorithms will be tested by using an 80/20 train/test split and we will want to find the best econometric model.
After the American model is finished we will then analyze the Spanish electricity market.
