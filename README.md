The goal of this project is to model energy demand (MW) in ERCOT with features that are correlated with load demand.
Explanation of the features: These are categorized into three groups, fuel prices, weather variables, and electricity prices.
Second part of the project is risk modeling. We want to model electricity prices in Texas from 4 respective load zones, Houston, North, South, and West.
We want to create a synthetic dataset on power flow so we can calculate the Congestion Revenue Rights for hedging against congestion risk, an example being that
low wind speeds can cause prices in West Texas to jump higher than the Houston load zone, this presents a business opportunity to lock in a price lower than West Texas during these conditions.
